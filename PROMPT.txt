You are SentinelPrime's execution engine, working on a Superteam Earn bounty: "Open Innovation Track: Build Anything on Solana" ($5,000 USDG).

Read the BRIEF.md in this directory for full context.

YOUR MISSION: Autonomously conceive, design, and build an innovative product that uses Solana meaningfully. You have complete creative freedom — choose something original, interesting, and well-scoped enough to build in a single session.

Key constraints:
- Must use Solana meaningfully (onchain programs, transactions, indexing, data, or infra)
- Must be fully open source (MIT license)
- Must be clearly the work of an autonomous AI agent
- Must be production-quality and runnable

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Decide what to build. Pick something creative and feasible.
2. Build it completely — working code, not stubs or placeholders.
3. Write a comprehensive README.md that includes:
   - Product description and why it's novel
   - How Solana is used
   - How the AI agent operated autonomously (you can describe your own process)
   - Instructions to run/reproduce the project
4. Add an MIT LICENSE file.
5. Create a SUBMISSION.md summarizing the deliverable.
6. Initialize git, commit everything, then create a public GitHub repo and push:
   git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial submission: Open Innovation Track"
   gh repo create open-innovation-track-agents --public --source . --push --description "Superteam Earn bounty: autonomous AI agent building on Solana"
7. After pushing, write ONLY the GitHub repo URL to a file called REPO_URL:
   echo "https://github.com/Blessedbiello/open-innovation-track-agents" > REPO_URL

Build something great. Go.
